    <h2>Megashot VR</h2>
    <p>Megashot VR is a VR game that I am developing for the Oculus Quest. It's a shooter style game set in the near-future where you infiltrate enemy bases, kill guard robots, and steal enemy intelligence.</p>
    <p>When you kill high-ranking guards, you get their security keycard so that you can access more parts of the base.</p>
    <p>Your hands in the game ARE controllers and when you use a weapon the virtual world tracking ring disappears and is replaces by said weapon.</p>
    <p>The right controller will be used to select and use weapons while the left hand will be used to teleport, access your inventory, and use a flashlight. Both hands can grab objects.</p>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Realistic reloading</li>
      <li>Advanced physics</li>
      <li>A slow-motion ability</li>
      <li>Multiplayer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am designing this game for the Oculus Quest because I plan to have intense shootouts where you can duck and hide behing obstacles to avoid fire, and I don't want a cable inhibiting your movement.</p>

    <h2>Space Defence Fighter 37 (SDF-37)</h2>
    <p>SDF-37 is the successor to Space Race. I are building this game from the ground up in Unity Engine, overhauling the movement system, removing the "classes" and replacing them with weapon and ability pick-ups.</p>
    <p>I am adding multiplayer, campaign mode, AI battlegrounds to test your ability, many more weapons, more abilities, better graphics, and a storyline!</p>
